            RULES FOR IMPROVING ORDER VELOCITY:

            1. C2 CREDIT HOLDS: Improve Order Velocity
            a. If a C2 hold has not been released, reach out to Credit Team for support releasing the hold or next steps required
            b. Identify the bill-to account numbers placed on credit hold
            c. Review the bill-to accounts placed on credit hold: do any accounts have negative available credit limit?
                i. If yes, review the account's open AR and past due AR
                ii. Do the accounts with credit holds have significant past due AR?
                    1. If yes, reach out to Collections Team for update on status of account
                    2. If no, reach out to Credit Team and request credit limit realignment
            d. Note: it is important to review credit holds even if all holds are released, there is still opportunity for action

            2. RR (REVENUE RECOGNITION) HOLDS: Improve Order Velocity
            a. Has the RR hold been released?
                i. If yes, then check:
                    1. Has the order been shipped?
                    2. If the order has not been shipped, when is the order release date?
                    3. If the order release date is in the past, use E1 to check TN for update on order then reach out to appropriate internal team for update/action
                ii. If no, then check:
                    1. Is the order requested date well in the future?
                    2. Are there any additional holds on the order? Can any actions be taken on other hold codes?
                    3. If the order requested date is not in the future, need to reach out to Finance for status update/action plan

            3. LENGTHY HOLD DURATIONS (i.e. CF, PM, S2, etc Holds): Improve Order Velocity
            a. Has the hold been released?
                i. If yes:
                    1. Has the order shipped? If yes, no action
                    2. Is the order release date in the past? If yes, check order in E1 for updates and reach out to appropriate internal team for update/action
                    3. If order release date in future, monitor to ensure order releases and ships as expected
                ii. If no:
                    1. When is the order release date?
                        a. If in the future, no action
                    2. If in the past, check order in E1 for updates and reach out to appropriate internal team for update/action
